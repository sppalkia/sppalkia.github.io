### Projects

#### Weld

Weld is a runtime for improving the performance of data-intensive applications.
It optimizes computations _across_ calls to different functions (and even
across libraries) by using a small common intermediate representation, similar
to CUDA and OpenCL. This IR is designed to support transformations such as loop
fusion and vectorization easily, even in workflows that combine libraries, and
it can improve performance over native analytics libraries (_e.g.,_ Pandas,
NumPy, or TensorFlow) by over an order of magnitude by reducing data movement.
