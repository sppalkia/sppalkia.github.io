I enjoy baking in my spare time. Though I have a slight bias for baking cookies and cakes, I also
enjoy baking breads, savory pastries, and candies. My wife [Paroma](https://www.paroma.xyz) is a
frequent contributor/taste tester in these ventures!

## Kouign Amann

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/kouign-amann.jpeg">
</div>

Kouign Amann is a pastry made with a laminated dough, with sugar folded into the layers. Think of
it as a caramelized croissant. It is one of my favorite French confections.

## Sugar Cake

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/sugar-cake.jpeg">
</div>

A cake with three kinds of sugar: a moist sponge with burnt sugar syrup, a caramel sauce, and a spun
sugar decoration on top. Surprisingly not as sweet as it sounds!

## French Macarons

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/macaron.jpeg">
</div>

French macarons with a coconut buttercream filling. This was my first time making a cookie based on
a meringue.

## Coconut Cake

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/coconut-cake.jpeg">
</div>

A coconut cake with buttercream roses. The cake itself is made with coconut milk and shredded
coconut, and the cream cheese frosting also has a splash of coconut flavor. Based on
[this recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/coconut-cake/).

## Strawberry Cake

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/strawberry-cake.jpg">
</div>

A strawberry cake through-and-through: this is a white cake with strawberry purée, iced with a
strawberry cream cheese frosting, and topped with fresh (you guessed it) strawberries.

## Floral Buttercream Mocha Cake

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/flower-cake.jpg">
</div>

An espresso-infused chocolate cake with a floral vanilla buttercream frosting. One of my favorites
so far!

## Vanilla Crème Brûlée

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/creme-brulee.jpg">
</div>

A vanilla crème brûlée based on [this recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/creme-brulee/).
Making this was an excuse to use a blowtorch to caramelize the sugar!

## Chocolate Croissant

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/choco-croissant.jpg">
</div>

A chocolate croissant based on the croissant recipe
[here](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-croissants/). I had more success shaping the
chocolate croissants than I did a traditional croissant, though I hope to try traditional croissants
again soon.

## Nutella Babka

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/nutella-babka.jpg">
</div>

A babka swirled with nutella. Probably one of my favorite homemade bakes in terms of taste! Also the
offering I gave to my [PhD advisor](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/) as a substitute for not being
able to bring chocolate to my (remote) thesis defense. Based on
[this recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/nutella-babka/).

## Hazelnut Cake

<div class="row">
<img src="/static/images/baking/hazelnut-cake.jpg">
</div>

A three-layer cake infused with hazelnut liquor and fresh hazelnut. The frosting is
chocolate-hazelnut (from scratch; nutella would have been too sweet). Definitely the cake whose
icing job I am most proud of.

## Mirror Glaze Cake

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/mirror-glaze.jpg">
</div>

A "form over function" type of cake. My cousin stated she wanted a "purple cake" for her birthday,
and this was the best I could come up with. The cake itself was a standard white cake with purple
food coloring; the glaze is made from a mixture of gelatin, corn syrup, and white chocolate, with
some gold food dust for extra effect.

## Cake Pops

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/cakepop.jpg">
</div>

Red velvet cake pops for my younger cousin's birthday. The cake is a baked red velvet decimated into
crumbs and squeezed into a ball. The outer layer is white chocolate.

## Bread Loaf

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/first-bread.jpg">
</div>

The first bread loaf I ever made. I thought it looked pretty good, but if I remember correctly, it
was very slightly underbaked and had a somewhat strange taste. I either didn't put enough salt or
proved it for too long.

## Classic Samosa

<div class="row">
  <img src="/static/images/baking/samosa.jpg">
</div>

A classic potatoes-and-onions samosa. Though not exactly a "bake," I'm adding it here since this was
inspired by a challenge on _The Great British Baking Show_.
