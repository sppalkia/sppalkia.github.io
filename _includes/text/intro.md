I am a second year Ph.D. student at Stanford University, advised by [Prof. Matei
Zaharia](http://people.csail.mit.edu/matei/). My research interests include
cloud computing, distributed systems, and computer networks.

During the 2015-2016 academic year I was at MIT with Matei,
supported by a Jacobs Presidential Fellowship.

Before that, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science.
