### In the Past

From 2016-2020, I was a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at
Stanford University, advised by [Prof. Matei
Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/). My dissertation work was on making
interfaces for composing independently written software systems more efficient
on modern hardware. You can find the slides for my Ph.D. defense talk
[here](static/papers/shoumik-defense-slides.pdf) and a video recording
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qze_aB4dPDw). The full dissertation is
available [here](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13595445).

During the 2015-2016 academic year I was at MIT working in the [PDOS
Lab](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu), and was supported by a Jacobs Presidential
Fellowship. Before that, I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science from UC Berkeley where I worked with Profs. Scott Shenker and
Sylvia Ratnasamy in the [NetSys Lab](https://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu) on E2, a
scalable, high performance framework for NFV.
