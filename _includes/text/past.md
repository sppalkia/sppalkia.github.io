### In the Past

During the 2015-2016 academic year I was at MIT working in the [PDOS
Lab](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu), and was supported by a Jacobs Presidential
Fellowship. Before that, I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science from UC Berkeley where I worked with Profs. Scott Shenker and
Sylvia Ratnasamy in the [NetSys Lab](https://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu) on E2, a
scalable, high performance framework for NFV.
