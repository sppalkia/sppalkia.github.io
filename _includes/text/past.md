### In the Past

During the 2015-2016 academic year I was at MIT working in the [PDOS
Lab](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu), and was supported by a Jacobs Presidential
Fellowship. Before that, I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science from UC Berkeley where I worked with Scott Shenker and Sylvia
Ratnasamy in the [NetSys Lab](http://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu) on E2, a scalable,
high performance framework for NFV.
