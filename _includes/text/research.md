At Berkeley, I had the great privilege of working with Scott Shenker and Sylvia
Ratnasamy in the [NetSys Lab](http://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu), where I worked on
designing a scalable, high performance framework for Virtualized Network
Functions.

At MIT, I will join the [PDOS Lab](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu), where I plan to
explore new problems in the systems domain.

My CV is [here].
