I am a part of the [Infolab](http://infolab.stanford.edu) at Stanford, where I
am continuing work I did at MIT in the [PDOS Lab](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu),
exploring novel representations of data-parallel programs which enable 
automatic high performance parallel code generation.

At Berkeley, I had the great privilege of working with Prof. Scott Shenker and
Prof. Sylvia Ratnasamy as an undergraduate in the [NetSys
Lab](http://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu), where I worked on designing a scalable,
high performance framework for Virtualized Network Functions.

My CV is [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10572674/cv.pdf).
