At MIT, I work in the [PDOS Lab](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu), exploring novel
representations of data-parallel programs that will allow for automated high
performance code generation.

At Berkeley, I had the great privilege of working with Prof. Scott Shenker and
Prof. Sylvia Ratnasamy as an undergraduate in the [NetSys
Lab](http://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu), where I worked on designing a scalable,
high performance framework for Virtualized Network Functions.

My CV is [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10572674/cv.pdf).
