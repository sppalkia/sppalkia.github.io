I am a third year Ph.D. student at Stanford University, advised by [Prof.
Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/). My research interests include
performance in cloud computing, distributed systems, and computer networks.

I am affiliated with [Stanford DAWN](http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu) where I work
on Weld, a novel interface for data analytics libraries which enables
optimizations and fast code generation *across* libraries and frameworks such
as NumPy and Spark. Weld is open source [here](http://weld.stanford.edu).
