I am a second year Ph.D. student at Stanford University, advised by [Prof. Matei
Zaharia](http://people.csail.mit.edu/matei/). My research interests include
cloud computing, distributed systems, and computer networks.

I am affilated with the [Infolab](http://infolab.stanford.edu), where I
am exploring novel representations of data-parallel programs which enable 
automatic high performance parallel code generation.

During the 2015-2016 academic year I was at MIT working in the [PDOS
Lab](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu) with Prof. Zaharia, and was supported by a
Jacobs Presidential Fellowship. Before that, I graduated from UC Berkeley with
a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

At Berkeley, I had the great privilege of working with Prof. Scott Shenker and
Prof. Sylvia Ratnasamy as an undergraduate in the [NetSys
Lab](http://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu), where I worked on designing a scalable,
high performance framework for Virtualized Network Functions.

My CV is [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10572674/cv.pdf).
