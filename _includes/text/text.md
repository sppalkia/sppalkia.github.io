I am currently a software engineer at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com).
I work on [Photon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54YMz8zvCY), a new native
vectorized execution engine for Spark SQL.

Before joining Databricks, I was a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science
department at Stanford University, advised by [Prof. Matei
Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/). My dissertation work focused on
designing new interfaces for efficient software library composition on modern
hardware. The full dissertation is available
[here](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13595445).
