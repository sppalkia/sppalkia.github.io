I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Stanford
University, advised by [Prof. Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
My research interests revolve around making data-driven systems fast, scalable,
and secure. I am primarily affiliated with the [Stanford DAWN
Lab](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu).
