I am currently a software engineer at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com)
working on [Photon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54YMz8zvCY), a new native
vectorized execution engine for Spark SQL.

Before joining Databricks, I was a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science
department at Stanford University, advised by [Prof. Matei
Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/). My dissertation work was on making
interfaces for composing independently written software systems more efficient
on modern hardware. You can find the slides for my Ph.D. defense talk
[here](static/papers/shoumik-defense-slides.pdf) and a video recording
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qze_aB4dPDw). The full dissertation is
available [here](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13595445).
