I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Stanford University,
advised by [Prof. Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).  I am
primarily affiliated with the [Stanford DAWN
Lab](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu). My research interests revolve around making
data-driven systems fast, scalable, and secure.

I am graduating in Spring 2020 and joining
[Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) as a software engineer, working on a
new execution engine for Spark SQL. I recently defended my Ph.D. thesis: you
can find the slides for my talk
[here](static/papers/shoumik-defense-slides.pdf) and a video recording
[here](https://youtu.be/UrWD3Z9kMbY).
