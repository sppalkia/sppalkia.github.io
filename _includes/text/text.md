I am a second year Ph.D. student at Stanford University, advised by [Prof.
Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/). My research interests include
performance in cloud computing, distributed systems, and computer networks.

I am affiliated with the [Infolab](http://infolab.stanford.edu) where I work on
Weld, a novel interface for data analytics libraries which enables
optimizations and fast code generation *across* libraries and frameworks such
as NumPy and Spark. Weld is open source [here](http://weld.stanford.edu).

During the 2015-2016 academic year I was at MIT working in the [PDOS
Lab](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu), and was supported by a Jacobs Presidential
Fellowship. Before that, I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science from UC Berkeley where I worked with Scott Shenker and Sylvia
Ratnasamy in the [NetSys Lab](http://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu) on E2, a scalable,
high performance framework for NFV.

My CV is [here](static/cv.pdf).
