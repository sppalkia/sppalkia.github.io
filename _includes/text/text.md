I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Stanford
University, advised by [Prof. Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
I am primarily affiliated with the [Stanford DAWN Lab](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu). My research interests revolve around
making data-driven systems fast, scalable, and secure.
