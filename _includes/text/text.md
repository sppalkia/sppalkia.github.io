I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Stanford
University, advised by [Prof. Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
My research focuses on the performance of data analytics and machine learning
systems and computer networks.

I am affiliated with [Stanford DAWN](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu) where I work
on Weld, a new interface for data analytics libraries that enables
optimizations and fast code generation *across* libraries and frameworks such
as NumPy and Spark. Weld is open source [here](https://www.weld.rs).
